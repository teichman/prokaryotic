# This is pretty janky but I guess will do for now.
# Eventually this shouldn't be YAML, just a DSL that is compiled into C++ objects representing the expressions.
DNA:
  - if: ATP Synthase < 300
    then:
      - ATP Synthase += 1.0
  - if: ATP Synthase < 200
    then:
      - all = 0.0
      - ATP Synthase = 1.0
